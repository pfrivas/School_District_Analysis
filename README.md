# School District Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze the data for the math and reading standardized test results of an entire School District as well as analyzing the correlation to between sets of data such as funding and student grades, in order to learn new insights and visually provide clear results on each school's performance. This analysis was conducted twice due to potential academic dishonesty among a group of students at one of the high schools in the school district. The group's test scores in question were omitted from the shool district analysis.
