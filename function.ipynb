    "# OVERVIEW OF FUNCTIONS\n",
    "    # When writing algorithms that perform a repetitive task, like getting grade averages over and over again, \n",
    "        # it's a best practice to convert the algorithm to a function. \n",
    "        # A function is a smaller, more manageable piece of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Long algorithms can increase the chance of syntax errors and repeated variable assignments, \n",
    "        # which can lead to programming headaches—especially if your code is more than 200 lines. \n",
    "        # Breaking your code into manageable pieces has many advantages. \n",
    "        # You can:\n",
    "            # Debug and fix errors faster.\n",
    "            # Make your code more readable.\n",
    "            # Reuse code by importing functions into other algorithms.\n",
    "            # Speed up programming development. \n",
    "                # Multiple team members can work on separate functions of a complex algorithm to speed up the development of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # A hallmark of professional programmers is that they can take long blocks of code and write smaller pieces of that code as functions.\n",
    "        # There are four basic parts to a function:\n",
    "            # The name, which is what we call the function\n",
    "            # The parameters, which are values we send to the function\n",
    "            # The code block, which are the statements under the function that perform the task\n",
    "            # The return value, which is what the function gives back, or \"returns,\" to use when the task is complete"

    "        # It's generally thought of as a best coding practice to write the name of the function as a verb, as functions perform actions. \n",
    "        # However, Python requires that you follow the same rules that you follow when naming variables.\n",
    "            # Variable names in Python can be any length and can consist of the following:\n",
    "                # Uppercase letters (A–Z)\n",

    "                # Underscores (_). Also, the first character of a variable name cannot be a digit.\n",
    "    # When it comes to naming functions, there are two additional rules and two caveats to the variable naming rules.\n",
    "        # The name cannot be a Python keyword.\n",
